purge-old-kernels
=================

Particularly useful on computers with limited disk space under the /boot
partition, on a Debian-based system, this simple utility purges all
successfully installed versions of the Linux kernel except the one
currently running and the last successfully installed kernel (which may
or may not be the same as the one currently running).
